class Person # Person is an object 
end

adele_goldberg = Person.new # .new is the instance of the object Person. adele_goldberg is a variable you've defined as an instance of a Person. You've used an instance .new to make the object Person do something. This is a good example of how an object can be used to do something with an instance. Object is like a noun, instance is the verb.
